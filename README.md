### Name of Student
Christopher Cahill
### Name of Project
Portland City Squash League Web Application 2.0
### Minimum features the project requires
* Player registration
* Ability to assign players to different teams from one season to another
* Score reporting and match-win determination
* Integrate links towards US Squash (where league results will be hosted)

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* React/Redux
* Firebase
* Material-UI


### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Substitute request system (if you can't make a match)
* Chat/messaging system
* Arrange a challenge match (i.e. to challenge a player on your team to take their spot) - admin notification, etc.

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs or other resources will these additional features require?
* TBD

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I want my MVP to, at the least, be a decent replacement for the very outdated [www.portlandsquash.org](http://www.portlandsquash.org). My goal for this project is to provide a way for league members to create a user profile, be assigned to teams by the league,

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).






## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
